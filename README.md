# Neural Collaborative Filtering 

## Goals
Building a recommendation systems with neural networks to predict whether an user will interact with each movie, with the goal of recommending the movies to users with the highest interaction likelihood.

## Datasets
MovieLens 25M Dataset <br />
<https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/> <br />

The dataset used in this project is **ratings.csv**, which contains 25000095 entries based on explicit feedback. The recommender system is trained using implicit feedback by binarizing the ratings and expanding the dataset about 5 times larger.

## Files
* eda.ipynb: Exploratory data analysis on the dataset. <br />
* data.py: Functions and classes for preparing the data based on pytorch lightning for the neural network then. <br />
* model.py: Architecture of the neural collaborative filtering based on pytorch lightning for training. <br />
* trainer.py: Main file to execute the training process. <br />
* evaluation.ipynb: File for evaluation with the metrices being Hit Ratio @ 5 and Hit Ratio @ 10. <br />
* best_model.pt: The trained model hitting the lowest val_loss. <br />

## Performance
Hit Ratio @ 5: 90.41% <br />
Hit Ratio @ 10: 96.49% <br />
